Compliance Policies

- Compliance policies help create the rules and settings that users and deices must meet to be compliant

- When Combined with Conditional Access, administrators can block users and devices that do not meet the rules

There are several ways to use compliance policies

- With the policy if the device doesn't comply, they will not get access to the organization resources
- Without conditional access, if the devices do not comply they don't get restricted but reports are generated for monitoring (audit).

Non-Compliant settings (security risk settings)

- Pin or password configuration
- Device encryption
- Jailbroken or rooted device
- Email profile (Make sure they use the organization email profile and not personal)
- Minimum OS version
- Maximum OS version
- Windows health attestation

The result of Non-Compliance

- Remediated: The device OS enforces compliance (force the user to update OS or pin)
- Quarantined: They will get a message that the device is not compliant
